# Dimensionality Reduction
Our task was to investigate methods of dimension reduction methods and show that for the presented data there exist such embedding dimensionality D’ < D which doesn’t decrease embeddings correspondence quality (top-1 accuracy).

# Embeddings clusterization
We were studying the clusterization methods and show that there exist clusters in the embeddings data. Perform the visualization of these data clusters.

# CelebA - Glasses
The first line contains the original images, the next two lines contain the modified ones. In this example, we change the components of the factorized vector and as a result we get photos of people with glasses.

# CelebA - Skin
By changing another component of the vector, the race of the people in the pictures changes.

# CelebA - Sex
By changing the component of the vector, we can also change the gender of a person

# CLIP
In the CLIP model, we can compare a text string with an image and determine how close they are to each other.
